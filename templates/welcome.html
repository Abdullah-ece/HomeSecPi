<!-- <h2>HomeSecPi - Home Security System Based on RaspberryPi</h2>
		<p>The aim of this project is to build a system that will allow the user to guard and monitor an area. The user will be able to control the system using a numeric keypad or the web control centre. When the system will detect motion, the system will warn and take a picture of the intruder, will allow him some time to type the correct passcode, if the passcode is not correct the picture will be sent to the systemâ€™s owner.</p>

		<p>Another feature will be a web streaming video, which will allow the user to monitor the area at anytime, or watch live what is happening to that area in case that an he informed about an unwelcome intruder.</p>

		<p>In addition, in order to prevent power and internet connection failures, a backup battery will be wired on the system, which will be able to charge and discharge at any time. The internet connection will be powered from a 3G portable stand-alone modem.</p>
